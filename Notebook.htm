    <h2 class = "note4head">3/24/2022:Wordle Clone done! + New website???</h2>
    <p class = "note4more">I made a simple wordle clone, and its also easy to remix. You can play it here: <a href = "https://glitch.com/~mywordleclone" > Wordle Clone </a>

    <h2 class = "note4head">7/04/2022:Wordle Helper done!; working on new website</h2>
    <p class = "note4more">My wordle clone takes the hints given by wordle and uses it to find a suitable word to try. You can use it here: <a href = "https://wordle-helper3.glitch.me/" > Wordle Helper </a> 
    I am also working on a new version of my website; V3; It will be done with eleventy so writing notes will be easier. The website will also look better and not be so scuffed.</p>
  </div>
    
   <div class="note6">
    <h2 class = "note4head">6/13/2023:Update + Wordle & Wordle Helper redesign</h2>
    <p class = "note4more">So it's been a year since last update because I've been super busy with school, and havent had much time to work on anything. Recently I updated my Wordle Clone and Wordle Helper with a lightmode and animations. Worlde Clone now works on mobile, with general improvements. 
      The new versions can be found here <a href = "https://wordle-helper4.glitch.me/" > Wordle Helper v4 </a> & <a href = "https://mywordleclonelight.glitch.me/" > Wordle v2 </a>
      During the months of July and June I will be busy away in China, so in the mean time I might make a new game and keep working on my new website. I'll have to do more reaserch on 11venty, change to using React.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note7">
    <h2 class = "note4head">3/03/2024:School and Java</h2>
    <p class = "note4more">Wow 7 months have passed already??? This website is over two years old now, and Im in grade 12! Less work at school, but there is other stuff so I still havent had much time for web dev, but I really do miss it. 
     I am in compsci tho, and its been fun, im in the same class as my friend so we help each other out. We are learning now java so Ive had to do stuff on that, but its been ok.
      Learned a bunch o new stuff like real OOP!, and just generally improved my coding. Last semester I didnt have many assignments so I could work on my own projects, like I made a connect 4 game with graphics and a racing game which was super fun. Unfortanitly, this semester Ive been busy and theres more assignments, so while 
    I really wanted to make a game with libGDX(I spent a while getting that set up too), I cant until I get caught up. With that, I might get some time in class for the next couple of months, so I will try to make a game. Im not sure what it will be just yet, but its gonna be big. Finally, the new website is not comming, at least not soon.
    Im working on other stuff now, but maybe, maybe one day.. a new website will come...</p>
